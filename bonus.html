           <h1 style="color: aqua">Nightingale </h1>
           <p>The common nightingale, rufous nightingale or simply nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), is a small passerine bird best known for its powerful and beautiful song.</p>
            <li>Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise.</li>
            <li>The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo, absent from the song of thrush nightingale. It has a frog-like alarm call.</li>
            <li> It is not found naturally in the Americas.</li>
